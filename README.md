# Optimizing Horiseon Website for Search Engines

## Description

A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. This existing site is for Horiseon Social Solution Services. It is important that a website is accessible so that people with disability will be able to access the website like everyone else. They can do this with the use of devices such as video captions, screen readers and braille keyboards. Therefore, I needed to make sure that the images on the website have good 'alt' attributes. These attributes are "short written description of an image, which makes sense of that image when it can't be viewed for some reason" (Parry, 2020). Not only will it help the accessibility for the disabled but it will also make the SEO of the website better. Semantic HTML elements were used to replace Non-semantic elements as these will make the codes readable to other developers and will be easier for browsers to interpret. 

I was tasked to make the web accessibility better by meeting the following standards:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

Each of the images and icons on the webpage has alt attributes which can be viewed by opening Chrome Dev Tools. This can be done by pressing Command+Option+C (macOS) or Control+Shift+C (Windows) and hovering to the image you want to see the alternative texts. It can also be done by right clicking on an image and select Inspect. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.

## Features

One of the features that was added in this website is the icon on the title bar. For now the "H" letter from the Horiseon title on the website was used for the image. This can be changed once the company decides to change the branding or the icon. Adding an icon or what we call "favicon" on the title bar is considered to be good for the SEO of the website. There might be no direct SEO or search rank effect by adding this icon but there are some indirect benefits which is increased usability of site and the other benefit is easy remembrance when looking at the bookmark (Snow-Wasserman, 2018). Using favicons will also help users remember the website whilst they continue to browse different URLs.
